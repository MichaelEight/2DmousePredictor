Compare math vs AI

LEGEND
- todo
V done

Math:
- using (math1) formulas but enhanced with changable x size

AI:
- train model based on user moving mouse around
- input: 10 or more (x,y) pairs, where mouse have been so far
- output: 1 predicted (x,y) pair where mouse will be

rating:
V difference between predicted (x,y) and actual (x,y)
  V either distance formula or (dx + dy) 

goals:
- compare accuracy and speed of both methods (response time is important)
- path predictor by putting predicted point into input 
- sub-path, so points between last input and predicted point 

settings:
V toggle continuous i.e. when mouse stops, either continue predicting or pause
- pass settings to main. IF empty, use defaults
